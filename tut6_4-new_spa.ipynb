    "# Routed Sequencing with Cleanup all Memory\n",

    "# The previous model on Routed Sequencing with cleanup memory used a scalar\n",
    "# ensemble to project only state 'A'. In this model, you will project all the\n",
    "# states onto an ensemble of neurons as the state cycles through a five element\n",
    "# sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This model has parameters as described in the book. It extends the routed\n",
    "# sequencing model by creating a scalar ensemble 'cleanup' and then projecting\n",
    "# all the states on to this ensemble using a transformation matrix 'pd_new',\n",
    "# specified by the vectors in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Press the play button to run the simulation.\n",
    "# The graph in the middle shows the semantic pointer representation of the\n",
    "# values stored in state and the graph on the bottom-right shows the response of\n",

    "# (similarity) of the current basal ganglia input (i.e., state) with the\n",
    "# possible vocabulary vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since the cleanup operation is similar to a dot product between the state and\n",

    "# allows the system to choose between two different actions: whether to go\n",
    "# through the sequence, or be driven by the visual input as explained in the\n",
    "# book. For instance, if the visual input has its value set to 0.8*START+D, the\n",
